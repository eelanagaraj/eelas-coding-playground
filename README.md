# eelas-coding-playground
All kinds of fun coding, including project euler problems, bug investigations, scratch code worth saving, etc. that shouldn't necessarily live in my private repo but also don't necessarily warrent their own repos (yet).

Project euler:
- My solutions for some project euler problems

Bug investigations:
- Investigations into weird behavior/bugs in Python packages
- currently includes an investigation of a potential bug in the `itertools` library that I have not yet had the time to submit a bug report for.
